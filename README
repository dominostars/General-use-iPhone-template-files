OBSOLETE. Only compatible with XCode 3.x

These template files include highly used methods, and a private category, for the following classes:

NSObject
UIView
UIViewController

For a UIViewController, you can choose to include a UITableView. If you select UIViewController with a table view and no XIB, it will initialize the table view for you in -viewDidLoad. If you opt for a XIB, it will create all the appropriate connections for you.

****************

To have these templates show up in XCode 3.x:

1. 
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/File\ Templates/GGTemplates

2. Replace (absolute path to root of repo) with the actual path:

ln -s (absolute path to root of repo)/GGTemplates ~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/File\ Templates/GGTemplates

3. Vua-la! It should now show up when you try to create a new file in XCode (under User Templates)
